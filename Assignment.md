## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

List at least **four key concepts or skills** you learned during the Git crash course. For each one, write a brief explanation of how it helped you manage your portfolio project more effectively.



- **Commit Messages**: They taught me how to write clear and descriptive commit messages, making it easier to track changes.

- **Merging**: It showed me how to combine changes from different branches safely. 

- **Creating Milestones**: It helped me break the project into phases with clear goals. 

- **Using Labels and Issues**: Enabled better project management by categorizing tasks and bugs. Issues helped me split my milestones effectively while labels helped me manage my issues well.
